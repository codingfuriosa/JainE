-- ONLY PRE-SALES CALLS OF AT LEAST 60 SECONDS ARE QUEUED FOR TRANSCRIPTION (requirement, 2026-10-01).
--
-- 20260923140000 queued a qualifying lead's WHOLE recorded history, any team. Now a follow-up is
-- queued only when BOTH hold:
--   1. it was made by Pre-Sales personnel (acc.crm_personnel_team = 'Pre-Sales'), and
--   2. the CRM records its duration as 60 seconds or more. A follow-up with no CRM duration is still
--      queued - the worker falls back to the audio header and applies the same 60s floor there.
-- The same two conditions gate which calls qualify a lead on the decision day. Everything else
-- (decision-day gate, Durbaar Banquets exclusion, no re-queueing, ordering) is unchanged.
