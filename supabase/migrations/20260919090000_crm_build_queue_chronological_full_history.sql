-- REBUILD OF crm_build_queue TO THE FINALIZED FLOW REQUIREMENTS (2026-09-19).
--
-- 1. QUALIFICATION (unchanged in spirit from 20260918150000, restated here for clarity): a lead
--    qualifies for this snapshot only when it has a Pre-Sales call, WITH A RECORDING, whose own call
--    date is the decision date itself (the snapshot's own date - never a call from an earlier or later
--    day), and that call is not for Durbaar Banquets.
--
-- 2. WHAT QUEUES, once a lead qualifies - REVERTED from 20260918150000's Pre-Sales-only restriction,
--    by explicit requirement: a qualifying lead's ENTIRE recorded follow-up history queues, any team,
--    any date, Sales calls included - not just its Pre-Sales calls. A same-day Sales call riding
--    alongside the qualifying Pre-Sales call is queued, not skipped. A Sales-ONLY decision day (no
--    Pre-Sales call that day) still disqualifies the lead completely, regardless of history - nothing
--    for it queues, that call or any other.
--
-- 3. ORDERING - new by explicit requirement: process leads one at a time, in the order of their own
--    first (oldest) call among what is being queued, and within a lead, oldest call to newest - not
--    newest-first as every prior version of this function has queued. This only reorders queue_seq for
--    NEW rows; nothing already queued is touched or reordered.
--
-- Nothing already in acc.transcription_queue, acc.call_transcripts or acc.followup_qa is touched by
-- this migration - only what a future snapshot queues from here on.
